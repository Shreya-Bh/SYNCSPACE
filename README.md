# SyncSpace
SyncSpace is a web application for managing employee attendance and tasks, developed during my IOCL internship and expanded for my BCA degree. It enhances accountability, collaboration, and efficiency with secure OTP-based attendance, real-time task tracking, admin features, and detailed histories. Reports exclude Sundays for accuracy.
