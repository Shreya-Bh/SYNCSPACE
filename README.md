# SyncSpace

Welcome to SyncSpace, a powerful web application designed to manage employee attendance and task assignments efficiently. SyncSpace was initially developed during my internship at IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) and I further expanded it for my BCA degree project. This platform aims to foster accountability, collaboration, and streamlined operations within organizations by providing a robust system for tracking attendance and task progress.

## Features

### Attendance Management
- Secure attendance marking using an OTP system to ensure authenticity.
- Employees can easily mark their attendance and download their monthly attendance reports.
- Attendance reports automatically exclude Sundays, providing an accurate representation of workdays.

### Task Management
- Managers can assign tasks to single employees or multiple employees within their department.
- Tasks are recorded with precise timestamps for both assignment and completion.
- Employees can mark tasks as complete, providing a clear visual distinction with green borders for completed tasks and red borders for incomplete ones.
- Detailed task history allows employees to view the progress of their individual and team tasks.

### User Profile Management
- Employees have the ability to update their profiles, including changing their passwords and editing their personal information (name and phone number).

### Administrative Features
- Users can request to become an admin, and existing admins can approve these requests.
- Admins have the authority to add new departments and managers.
- Comprehensive access to attendance reports for all departments, with the option to view individual employee reports.
- Attendance reports can be downloaded for further analysis and record-keeping.

SyncSpace is designed to enhance the workflow of any organization by providing clear visibility into attendance and task management. Its intuitive interface and robust feature set make it an invaluable tool for improving accountability, fostering collaboration, and ensuring efficient management of daily operations.

## Note
This project initially used the Indian Oil Corporation (IOCL) logo because it was developed during my internship at IOCL and was built for their use. However, this project is not an official IOCL website, and IOCL has not published this project. The logo has since been removed from the project, but some screen recordings still contain the IOCL logo. These recordings are solely for educational purposes within the scope of the internship project.
